# Data formatting standards
---- 

All files associated with a given recording should be placed into a parent folder with the following basepath:

`/experimenter/animalID/`  

For example, if Darren Goffin is recording from animal H1234/17\_1, the basepath for this file would be:

`/darrengoffin/H1234.17_1/`  

Each recording from this animal would then have its own folder. For example: 

`/darrengoffin/H1234.17_1/isoflurane_1.0/`  
`/darrengoffin/H1234.17_1/isoflurane_1.5/`  
`/darrengoffin/H1234.17_1/isoflurane_2.0/`
